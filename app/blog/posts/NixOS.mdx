# NixOS: A Purely Functional Linux Distribution

Hey, glad you found this blog — it’s a good one. Let me start with a quick story about how I discovered this absolute banger of a distro.

Back in college, we had a Linux course. Around that time, one of my classmates told me to dual boot Linux. At first, I had no clue what “dual boot” even meant. I Googled it and figured out that it just means running two operating systems on one machine.

So I started watching YouTube videos on “How to dual boot Linux,” and stumbled upon one that explained how the whole dual boot process works. Then came the big question: *which distro to use?*

I already knew Linux had a ton of distributions, and eventually I landed on “Arch Linux.”  
**Yes, I tried to install Arch on my first attempt at dual booting.** (Crazy, I know.)

After failing three times, I finally managed to install Arch Linux with the KDE Plasma desktop on my fourth try.  
It worked, but… there was a catch — my system kept freezing after a while. I hit the web trying to debug the issue, but nothing really solved it.

During that desperate web search phase, I stumbled upon something called **NixOS**.

I dual booted it, started using it, and instantly fell in love with the idea: an immutable, declarative distro where everything is configured in *just one file*. You can roll back, rebuild, and do anything you want — with full control and reproducibility.

That was the beginning of my journey with NixOS.

Later, I came across the original paper:  
📄 [NixOS: A Purely Functional Linux Distribution](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/nixos-icfp2008-final.pdf)

Turns out, NixOS is based on the PhD thesis of **Eelco Dolstra**, titled:  
📘 *The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model*  
👉 [Read it here](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf)

Let me break it down:

- Eelco’s thesis = Nix  
- Nix = NixOS  
- NixOS = 💥 declarative Linux on steroids

And that’s how I ended up here — writing this post on a fully configured, declaratively managed, roll-backable beast of a system.

Stay tuned, there’s more coming — deep dives, config tips, and lessons learned.
